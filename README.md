# Pokemon
To start the game just open Bot_selection.
Ok so as i have multiple .html files that i needed to list between, i have refered them to the location of next file, and for me that was: C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Pokemon/YourDesiredFile.html (basically just have them all on desktop in Pokemon folder and hopefully you'll be fine fam). Or if you are the stubborn type, you can rewrite the location.href from Bot_selection and Pokemon_selection to the location you have them stored in and you'll be good to go as well.
