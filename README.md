# Pokemon
Ok so as i have multiple .html files that i needed to list between, i have refered them to the exact location of next document, which was: C:/Users/Admin/Desktop/Pokemon/Pokemon_selection1.html (basically just have them all on desktop in Pokemon folder and hopefully you'll be fine fam). Or if you are the stubborn type, you can rewrite the location.href from Bot_selection and Pokemon_selection to the location you have them stored in and you'll be good to go as well.
